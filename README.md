# Sum-scheme-

  Hello, my name is Andrew and this is a recursive algorithm I wrote in Scheme for my "Programming Languages" class.

  This program accepts a list of integers and recursively iterates from beginning to end of the list while comparing each
value with the rest of the list to find if the sum of any two integers equals zero. If a combination is found the program
returns true. If the list is empty or cdr becomes null because of no prior matches, we return false.
